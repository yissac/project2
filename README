Commit before pulling from the repository always using the following lines

COMMITTING:
git commit -a ---> enter
<type a message> ---> press crtl x
then type y and hit enter

PULLING:
git pull origin master

If you make some changes and want to update the repo then commit and push the changes

PUSHING AFTER COMMITING
git push

to add new files to the track list use:

git add <whatever file name>

this will let you push the file to the repo, however do not add the build files to the repo only the src files and the make file
